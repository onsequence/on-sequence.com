<p>Serial television series that are set in the past better reflect the era in which the work was created versus the era depicted.&nbsp;<em>Mad Men</em> tells us more about a post 9/11, post-financial crisis America than it does about the 1960s. Likewise,&nbsp;<em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> documents America's second tech-boom through the lens of it's first. In exploring the plight of early computation, it opens our imaginations to the possibilities of the future.&nbsp;</p>
